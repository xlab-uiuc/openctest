configuration.apollo.apolloEnv	DEV	Configure appolo environment
services[1].duration	20000	The sample rate precision is 1/10000. 10000 means 100% sample in default. Setting this threshold about the latency would make the slow trace segments sampled if they cost more time, even the sampling mechanism activated. The default value is `-1`, which means would not sample slow traces. Unit, millisecond.

services[1].name	name1	The sample rate precision is 1/10000. 10000 means 100% sample in default. Setting this threshold about the latency would make the slow trace segments sampled if they cost more time, even the sampling mechanism activated. The default value is `-1`, which means would not sample slow traces. Unit, millisecond.
services[0].rate	2000	The sample rate precision is 1/10000. 10000 means 100% sample in default. Setting this threshold about the latency would make the slow trace segments sampled if they cost more time, even the sampling mechanism activated. The default value is `-1`, which means would not sample slow traces. Unit, millisecond.
