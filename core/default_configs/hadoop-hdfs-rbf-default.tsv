dfs.federation.router.fairness.handler.count.EXAMPLENAMESERVICE		Dedicated handler count for nameservice EXAMPLENAMESERVICE. The handler (configed by dfs.federation.router.handler.count)resource is controlled internally by Semaphore permits. Two requirements have to be satisfied. 1) all downstream nameservices need this config otherwise no permit will be given thus not proxy will happen. 2) if a special *concurrent* nameservice is specified, the sum of all configured values is smaller or equal to the total number of router handlers; if the special *concurrent* is not specified, the sum of all configured values must be strictly smaller than the router handlers thus the left will be allocated to the concurrent calls.

dfs.federation.router.observer.read.default	false	Whether observer reads are enabled. This is a default for all nameservices. The default can be inverted for individual namespace by adding them to dfs.federation.router.observer.read.overrides.
dfs.federation.router.observer.read.overrides		Commas separated list of namespaces for which to invert the default configuration, dfs.federation.router.observer.read.default, for whether to enable observer reads.
dfs.federation.router.observer.federated.state.propagation.maxsize	5	The maximum size of the federated state to send in the RPC header. Sending the federated state removes the need to msync on every read call, but at the expense of having a larger header. The cost tradeoff between the larger header and always msync'ing depends on the number of namespaces in use and the latency of the msync requests.
