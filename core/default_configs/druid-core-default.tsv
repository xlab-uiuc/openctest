Druid will load the dependencies based on the hadoop coordinate specified in the hadoop index task.
druid.extensions.loadList	null	A JSON array of extensions to load from extension directories by Druid. If it is not specified, its value will be null and Druid will load all the extensions under druid.extensions.directory. If its value is empty list [], then no extensions will be loaded at all. It is also allowed to specify absolute path of other custom extensions not stored in the common extensions directory.
druid.extensions.searchCurrentClassloader	true	This is a boolean flag that determines if Druid will search the main classloader for extensions.  It defaults to true but can be turned off if you have reason to not automatically add all modules on the classpath.
druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst	false	This is a boolean flag that determines if Druid extensions should prefer loading classes from their own jars rather than jars bundled with Druid. If false, extensions must be compatible with classes provided by any jars bundled with Druid. If true, extensions may depend on conflicting versions.
druid.extensions.hadoopContainerDruidClasspath	null	Hadoop Indexing launches hadoop jobs and this configuration provides way to explicitly set the user classpath for the hadoop job. By default this is computed automatically by druid based on the druid process classpath and set of extensions. However, sometimes you might want to be explicit to resolve dependency conflicts between druid and hadoop.
druid.extensions.addExtensionsToHadoopContainer	false	Only applicable if druid.extensions.hadoopContainerDruidClasspath is provided. If set to true, then extensions specified in the loadList are added to hadoop container classpath. Note that when druid.extensions.hadoopContainerDruidClasspath is not provided then extensions are always added to hadoop container classpath.
druid.modules.excludeList	[]	A JSON array of canonical class names (e.g., "org.apache.druid.somepackage.SomeModule") of module classes which shouldn't be loaded, even if they are found in extensions specified by druid.extensions.loadList, or in the list of core modules specified to be loaded on a particular Druid process type.

druid.audit.manager.maxPayloadSizeBytes	-1	The maximum size of audit payload to store in Druid's metadata store audit table. If the size of audit payload exceeds this value, the audit log would be stored with a message indicating that the payload was omitted instead. Setting maxPayloadSizeBytes to -1 (default value) disables this check, meaning Druid will always store audit payload regardless of it's size. Setting to any negative number other than -1 is invalid. Human-readable format is supported, see [here](human-readable-byte.md).  
druid.audit.manager.skipNullField	false	If true, the audit payload stored in metadata store will exclude any field with null value. 
druid.monitoring.emissionPeriod	PT1M	 Frequency that Druid emits metrics.

druid.emitter.http.minHttpTimeoutMillis	0	If the speed of filling batches imposes timeout smaller than that, not even trying to send batch to endpoint, because it will likely fail, not being able to send the data that fast. Configure this depending based on emitter/successfulSending/minTimeMs metric. Reasonable values are 10ms..100ms.
druid.emitter.http.recipientBaseUrl	none, required config	The base URL to emit messages to. Druid will POST JSON to be consumed at the HTTP endpoint specified by this property.

druid.access.jdbc.enforceAllowedProperties	When true, Druid applies druid.access.jdbc.allowedProperties to JDBC connections starting with jdbc:postgresql:, jdbc:mysql:, or jdbc:mariadb:. When false, Druid allows any kind of JDBC connections without JDBC property validation. This config is for backward compatibility especially during upgrades since enforcing allow list can break existing ingestion jobs or lookups based on JDBC. This config is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.	Boolean
druid.access.jdbc.allowedProperties	Defines a list of allowed JDBC properties. Druid always enforces the list for all JDBC connections starting with jdbc:postgresql:, jdbc:mysql:, and jdbc:mariadb: if druid.access.jdbc.enforceAllowedProperties is set to true.<br/><br/>This option is tested against MySQL connector 5.1.49, MariaDB connector 2.7.4, and PostgreSQL connector 42.2.14. Other connector versions might not work.	List of JDBC properties

druid.server.http.errorResponseTransform.allowedRegex	[]	The list of regular expressions Druid uses to validate error messages. If the error message matches any of the regular expressions, then Druid includes it in the response unchanged. If the error message does not match any of the regular expressions, Druid replaces the error message with null or with a default message depending on the type of underlying Exception.

druid.generic.ignoreNullsForStringCardinality	false	When set to true, null values will be ignored for the built-in cardinality aggregator over string columns. Set to false to include null values while estimating cardinality of only string columns using the built-in cardinality aggregator. This setting takes effect only when druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull is set to true and is ignored in SQL compatibility mode. Additionally, empty strings (equivalent to null) are not counted when this is set to true. 
druid.global.http.numConnections	20	Size of connection pool per destination URL. If there are more HTTP requests than this number that all need to speak to the same URL, then they will queue up.
druid.global.http.eagerInitialization	true	Indicates that http connections should be eagerly initialized. If set to true, numConnections connections are created upon initialization
druid.global.http.compressionCodec	gzip	Compression codec to communicate with others. May be "gzip" or "identity".
druid.global.http.readTimeout	PT15M	The timeout for data reads.
druid.global.http.unusedConnectionTimeout	PT4M	The timeout for idle connections in connection pool. The connection in the pool will be closed after this timeout and a new one will be established.

druid.host	InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName()	The host for the current process. This is used to advertise the current processes location as reachable from another process and should generally be specified such that http://${druid.host}/ could actually talk to this process
druid.bindOnHost	false	Indicating whether the process's internal jetty server bind on druid.host. Default is false, which means binding to all interfaces.
druid.plaintextPort	8081	This is the port to actually listen on; unless port mapping is used, this will be the same port as is on druid.host
druid.tlsPort	8281	TLS port for HTTPS connector, if [druid.enableTlsPort](../operations/tls-support.md) is set then this config will be used. If druid.host contains port then that port will be ignored. This should be a non-negative Integer.
druid.service	druid/coordinator	The name of the service. This is used as a dimension when emitting metrics and alerts to differentiate between the various services
druid.coordinator.period	PT60S	The run period for the Coordinator. The Coordinator operates by maintaining the current state of the world in memory and periodically looking at the set of "used" segments and segments being served to make decisions about whether any changes need to be made to the data topology. This property sets the delay between each of these runs.
druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod	PT1800S (30 mins)	How often to send compact/merge/conversion tasks to the indexing service. It's recommended to be longer than druid.manager.segments.pollDuration
druid.coordinator.startDelay	PT300S	The operation of the Coordinator works on the assumption that it has an up-to-date view of the state of the world when it runs, the current ZK interaction code, however, is written in a way that doesn’t allow the Coordinator to know for a fact that it’s done loading the current state of the world. This delay is a hack to give it enough time to believe that it has all the data.
druid.coordinator.load.timeout	PT15M	The timeout duration for when the Coordinator assigns a segment to a Historical process.
druid.coordinator.kill.pendingSegments.on	true	Boolean flag for whether or not the Coordinator clean up old entries in the pendingSegments table of metadata store. If set to true, Coordinator will check the created time of most recently complete task. If it doesn't exist, it finds the created time of the earliest running/pending/waiting tasks. Once the created time is found, then for all dataSources not in the killPendingSegmentsSkipList (see [Dynamic configuration](#dynamic-configuration)), Coordinator will ask the Overlord to clean up the entries 1 day or more older than the found created time in the pendingSegments table. This will be done periodically based on druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod specified.
druid.coordinator.kill.on	false	Boolean flag for whether or not the Coordinator should submit kill task for unused segments, that is, permanently delete them from metadata store and deep storage. If set to true, then for all whitelisted dataSources (or optionally all), Coordinator will submit tasks periodically based on period specified. A whitelist can be set via dynamic configuration killDataSourceWhitelist described later.<br /><br />When druid.coordinator.kill.on is true, segments are eligible for permanent deletion once their data intervals are older than druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain relative to the current time. If a segment's data interval is older than this threshold at the time it is marked unused, it is eligible for permanent deletion immediately after being marked unused.
druid.coordinator.kill.period	P1D (1 Day)	How often to send kill tasks to the indexing service. Value must be greater than druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod. Only applies if kill is turned on.
druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain	P90D	Only applies if you set druid.coordinator.kill.on to true. This value is ignored if druid.coordinator.kill.ignoreDurationToRetain is true. Valid configurations must be a ISO8601 period. Druid will not kill unused segments whose interval end date is beyond now - durationToRetain. durationToRetain can be a negative ISO8601 period, which would result in now - durationToRetain to be in the future.<br /><br />Note that the durationToRetain parameter applies to the segment interval, not the time that the segment was last marked unused. For example, if durationToRetain is set to P90D, then a segment for a time chunk 90 days in the past is eligible for permanent deletion immediately after being marked unused.
druid.coordinator.kill.ignoreDurationToRetain	false	A way to override druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain and tell the coordinator that you do not care about the end date of unused segment intervals when it comes to killing them. If true, the coordinator considers all unused segments as eligible to be killed.
druid.coordinator.kill.maxSegments	100	Kill at most n unused segments per kill task submission, must be greater than 0. Only applies and MUST be specified if kill is turned on.
druid.coordinator.balancer.strategy	cost	Specify the type of balancing strategy for the coordinator to use to distribute segments among the historicals. cachingCost is logically equivalent to cost but is more CPU-efficient on large clusters. diskNormalized weights the costs according to the servers' disk usage ratios - there are known issues with this strategy distributing segments unevenly across the cluster. random distributes segments among services randomly.
druid.coordinator.balancer.cachingCost.awaitInitialization	false	Whether to wait for segment view initialization before creating the cachingCost balancing strategy. This property is enabled only when druid.coordinator.balancer.strategy is cachingCost. If set to 'true', the Coordinator will not start to assign segments, until the segment view is initialized. If set to 'false', the Coordinator will fallback to use the cost balancing strategy only if the segment view is not initialized yet. Notes, it may take much time to wait for the initialization since the cachingCost balancing strategy involves much computing to build itself.
druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.repeatDelay	PT0.050S (50 ms)	The start and repeat delay for the loadqueuepeon, which manages the load and drop of segments.
druid.coordinator.asOverlord.enabled	false	Boolean value for whether this Coordinator process should act like an Overlord as well.

druid.bindOnHost	false	Indicating whether the process's internal jetty server bind on druid.host. Default is false, which means binding to all interfaces.
druid.plaintextPort	8090	This is the port to actually listen on; unless port mapping is used, this will be the same port as is on druid.host
druid.tlsPort	8290	TLS port for HTTPS connector, if [druid.enableTlsPort](../operations/tls-support.md) is set then this config will be used. If druid.host contains port then that port will be ignored. This should be a non-negative Integer.
druid.service	druid/overlord	The name of the service. This is used as a dimension when emitting metrics and alerts to differentiate between the various services
druid.indexer.runner.type	local	Choices "local" or "remote". Indicates whether tasks should be run locally or in a distributed environment. Experimental task runner "httpRemote" is also available which is same as "remote" but uses HTTP to interact with Middle Managers instead of ZooKeeper.
druid.indexer.storage.type	local	Choices are "local" or "metadata". Indicates whether incoming tasks should be stored locally (in heap) or in metadata storage. "local" is mainly for internal testing while "metadata" is recommended in production because storing incoming tasks in metadata storage allows for tasks to be resumed if the Overlord should fail.
druid.indexer.storage.recentlyFinishedThreshold	PT24H	Duration of time to store task results. Default is 24 hours. If you have hundreds of tasks running in a day, consider increasing this threshold.
druid.indexer.tasklock.forceTimeChunkLock	true	_**Setting this to false is still experimental**_<br/> If set, all tasks are enforced to use time chunk lock. If not set, each task automatically chooses a lock type to use. This configuration can be overwritten by setting forceTimeChunkLock in the [task context](../ingestion/tasks.md#context). See [Task Locking & Priority](../ingestion/tasks.md#context) for more details about locking in tasks.

druid.indexer.queue.storageSyncRate	PT1M	Sync Overlord state this often with an underlying task persistence mechanism.
druid.indexer.runner.taskAssignmentTimeout	PT5M	How long to wait after a task as been assigned to a MiddleManager before throwing an error.
druid.indexer.runner.minWorkerVersion	"0"	The minimum MiddleManager version to send tasks to. The version number is a string. This affects the expected behavior during certain operations like comparison against druid.worker.version. Specifically, the version comparison follows dictionary order. Use ISO8601 date format for the version to accommodate date comparisons. 
druid.indexer.runner.compressZnodes	true	Indicates whether or not the Overlord should expect MiddleManagers to compress Znodes.
druid.indexer.runner.maxZnodeBytes	 512 KiB 	The maximum size Znode in bytes that can be created in ZooKeeper, should be in the range of [10KiB, 2GiB). [Human-readable format](human-readable-byte.md) is supported.

druid.indexer.runner.maxPercentageBlacklistWorkers	20	The maximum percentage of workers to blacklist, this must be between 0 and 100.
druid.indexer.autoscale.strategy	noop	Choices are "noop", "ec2" or "gce". Sets the strategy to run when autoscaling is required.
druid.indexer.autoscale.doAutoscale	false	If set to "true" autoscaling will be enabled.
druid.indexer.autoscale.provisionPeriod	PT1M	How often to check whether or not new MiddleManagers should be added.

druid.indexer.autoscale.workerCapacityHint	-1	 An estimation of the number of task slots available for each worker launched by the auto scaler when there are no workers running. The auto scaler uses the worker capacity hint to launch workers with an adequate capacity to handle pending tasks. When unset or set to a value less than or equal to 0, the auto scaler scales workers equal to the value for minNumWorkers in autoScaler config instead. The auto scaler assumes that each worker, either a middleManager or indexer, has the same amount of task slots. Therefore, when all your workers have the same capacity (homogeneous capacity), set the value for autoscale.workerCapacityHint equal to druid.worker.capacity. If your workers have different capacities (heterogeneous capacity), set the value to the average of druid.worker.capacity across the workers. For example, if two workers have druid.worker.capacity=10, and one has druid.worker.capacity=4, set autoscale.workerCapacityHint=8. Only applies to pendingTaskBased provisioning strategy.
druid.supervisor.healthinessThreshold	3	The number of successful runs before an unhealthy supervisor is again considered healthy.

druid.indexer.runner.classpath	System.getProperty("java.class.path")	Java classpath for the peon.
druid.indexer.runner.javaCommand	java	Command required to execute java.
druid.indexer.runner.javaOpts	""	*DEPRECATED* A string of -X Java options to pass to the peon's JVM. Quotable parameters or parameters with spaces are encouraged to use javaOptsArray
druid.indexer.runner.javaOptsArray	[]	A JSON array of strings to be passed in as options to the peon's JVM. This is additive to druid.indexer.runner.javaOpts and is recommended for properly handling arguments which contain quotes or spaces like ["-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=kill -9 %p"]
druid.indexer.runner.maxZnodeBytes	512KiB	The maximum size Znode in bytes that can be created in ZooKeeper, should be in the range of [10KiB, 2GiB). [Human-readable format](human-readable-byte.md) is supported.

druid.indexer.runner.ports	[]	A JSON array of integers to specify ports that used for peon processes. If provided and non-empty, ports for peon processes will be chosen from these ports. And druid.indexer.runner.startPort/druid.indexer.runner.endPort will be completely ignored.
druid.worker.ip	localhost	The IP of the worker.
druid.worker.version	0	Version identifier for the MiddleManager. The version number is a string. This affects the expected behavior during certain operations like comparison against druid.indexer.runner.minWorkerVersion. Specifically, the version comparison follows dictionary order. Use ISO8601 date format for the version to accommodate date comparisons.
druid.worker.capacity	Number of CPUs on the machine - 1	Maximum number of tasks the MiddleManager can accept.
druid.worker.category	_default_worker_category	A string to name the category that the MiddleManager node belongs to.
druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes	auto (max 1 GiB)	This specifies a buffer size (less than 2GiB) for the storage of intermediate results. The computation engine in both the Historical and Realtime processes will use a scratch buffer of this size to do all of their intermediate computations off-heap. Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed. [Human-readable format](human-readable-byte.md) is supported.
druid.processing.buffer.poolCacheMaxCount	Integer.MAX_VALUE	processing buffer pool caches the buffers for later use, this is the maximum count cache will grow to. note that pool can create more buffers than it can cache if necessary.
druid.processing.formatString	processing-%s	Realtime and Historical processes use this format string to name their processing threads.
druid.processing.numMergeBuffers	max(2, druid.processing.numThreads / 4)	The number of direct memory buffers available for merging query results. The buffers are sized by druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes. This property is effectively a concurrency limit for queries that require merging buffers. If you are using any queries that require merge buffers (currently, just groupBy v2) then you should have at least two of these.
druid.processing.numThreads	Number of cores - 1 (or 1)	The number of processing threads to have available for parallel processing of segments. Our rule of thumb is num_cores - 1, which means that even under heavy load there will still be one core available to do background tasks like talking with ZooKeeper and pulling down segments. If only one core is available, this property defaults to the value 1.
druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes	0 (disabled)	Maximum size in bytes for the dimension value lookup cache. Any value greater than 0 enables the cache. It is currently disabled by default. Enabling the lookup cache can significantly improve the performance of aggregators operating on dimension values, such as the JavaScript aggregator, or cardinality aggregator, but can slow things down if the cache hit rate is low (i.e. dimensions with few repeating values). Enabling it may also require additional garbage collection tuning to avoid long GC pauses.
druid.processing.fifo	true	If the processing queue should treat tasks of equal priority in a FIFO manner
druid.processing.tmpDir	path represented by java.io.tmpdir	Path where temporary files created while processing a query should be stored. If specified, this configuration takes priority over the default java.io.tmpdir path.
druid.processing.intermediaryData.storage.type	local	Storage type for storing intermediary segments of data shuffle between native parallel index tasks. Current choices are "local" which stores segment files in local storage of Middle Managers (or Indexer) or "deepstore" which uses configured deep storage. Note - With "deepstore" type data is stored in shuffle-data directory under the configured deep storage path, auto clean up for this directory is not supported yet. One can setup cloud storage lifecycle rules for auto clean up of data at shuffle-data prefix location.
druid.realtime.cache.useCache	Enable the cache on the realtime.	true, false
druid.realtime.cache.populateCache	Populate the cache on the realtime.	true, false
druid.realtime.cache.unCacheable	All query types to not cache.	All druid query types
druid.realtime.cache.maxEntrySize	Maximum cache entry size in bytes.	positive integer
druid.peon.mode	remote	Choices are "local" and "remote". Setting this to local means you intend to run the peon as a standalone process (Not recommended).
druid.indexer.task.baseDir	System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")	Base temporary working directory.
druid.indexer.task.baseTaskDir	${druid.indexer.task.baseDir}/persistent/task	Base temporary working directory for tasks.
druid.indexer.task.batchProcessingMode	CLOSED_SEGMENTS	 Batch ingestion tasks have three operating modes to control construction and tracking for intermediary segments: OPEN_SEGMENTS, CLOSED_SEGMENTS, and CLOSED_SEGMENT_SINKS. OPEN_SEGMENTS uses the streaming ingestion code path and performs a mmap on intermediary segments to build a timeline to make these segments available to realtime queries. Batch ingestion doesn't require intermediary segments, so the default mode, CLOSED_SEGMENTS, eliminates mmap of intermediary segments. CLOSED_SEGMENTS mode still tracks the entire set of segments in heap. The CLOSED_SEGMENTS_SINKS mode is the most aggressive configuration and should have the smallest memory footprint. It eliminates in-memory tracking and mmap of intermediary segments produced during segment creation. CLOSED_SEGMENTS_SINKS mode isn't as well tested as other modes so is currently considered experimental. You can use OPEN_SEGMENTS mode if problems occur with the 2 newer modes. 
druid.indexer.task.defaultHadoopCoordinates	org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-client:2.8.5	Hadoop version to use with HadoopIndexTasks that do not request a particular version.
druid.indexer.task.defaultRowFlushBoundary	75000	Highest row count before persisting to disk. Used for indexing generating tasks.

druid.indexer.task.gracefulShutdownTimeout	PT5M	Wait this long on middleManager restart for restorable tasks to gracefully exit.
druid.indexer.task.hadoopWorkingPath	/tmp/druid-indexing	Temporary working directory for Hadoop tasks.
druid.indexer.task.restoreTasksOnRestart	false	If true, MiddleManagers will attempt to stop tasks gracefully on shutdown and restore them on restart.
druid.indexer.task.ignoreTimestampSpecForDruidInputSource	false	If true, tasks using the [Druid input source](../ingestion/native-batch-input-source.md) will ignore the provided timestampSpec, and will use the __time column of the input datasource. This option is provided for compatibility with ingestion specs written before Druid 0.22.0.
druid.indexer.task.storeEmptyColumns	true	Boolean value for whether or not to store empty columns during ingestion. When set to true, Druid stores every column specified in the [dimensionsSpec](../ingestion/ingestion-spec.md#dimensionsspec). If you use schemaless ingestion and don't specify any dimensions to ingest, you must also set [includeAllDimensions](../ingestion/ingestion-spec.md#dimensionsspec) for Druid to store empty columns.<br/><br/>If you set storeEmptyColumns to false, Druid SQL queries referencing empty columns will fail. If you intend to leave storeEmptyColumns disabled, you should either ingest dummy data for empty columns or else not query on empty columns.<br/><br/>This configuration can be overwritten by setting storeEmptyColumns in the [task context](../ingestion/tasks.md#context-parameters).
druid.indexer.server.maxChatRequests	0	Maximum number of concurrent requests served by a task's chat handler. Set to 0 to disable limiting.

druid.bindOnHost	false	Indicating whether the process's internal jetty server bind on druid.host. Default is false, which means binding to all interfaces.
druid.plaintextPort	8091	This is the port to actually listen on; unless port mapping is used, this will be the same port as is on druid.host
druid.tlsPort	8283	TLS port for HTTPS connector, if [druid.enableTlsPort](../operations/tls-support.md) is set then this config will be used. If druid.host contains port then that port will be ignored. This should be a non-negative Integer.

druid.indexer.task.ignoreTimestampSpecForDruidInputSource	false	If true, tasks using the [Druid input source](../ingestion/native-batch-input-source.md) will ignore the provided timestampSpec, and will use the __time column of the input datasource. This option is provided for compatibility with ingestion specs written before Druid 0.22.0.
druid.indexer.task.storeEmptyColumns	true	Boolean value for whether or not to store empty columns during ingestion. When set to true, Druid stores every column specified in the [dimensionsSpec](../ingestion/ingestion-spec.md#dimensionsspec). If you use schemaless ingestion and don't specify any dimensions to ingest, you must also set [includeAllDimensions](../ingestion/ingestion-spec.md#dimensionsspec) for Druid to store empty columns.<br/><br/>If you set storeEmptyColumns to false, Druid SQL queries referencing empty columns will fail. If you intend to leave storeEmptyColumns disabled, you should either ingest dummy data for empty columns or else not query on empty columns.<br/><br/>This configuration can be overwritten by setting storeEmptyColumns in the [task context](../ingestion/tasks.md#context-parameters).

druid.server.http.maxIdleTime	PT5M	The Jetty max idle time for a connection.
druid.server.http.enableRequestLimit	false	If enabled, no requests would be queued in jetty queue and "HTTP 429 Too Many Requests" error response would be sent. 
druid.server.http.defaultQueryTimeout	300000	Query timeout in millis, beyond which unfinished queries will be cancelled
druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout	PT30S	The maximum amount of time Jetty waits after receiving shutdown signal. After this timeout the threads will be forcefully shutdown. This allows any queries that are executing to complete(Only values greater than zero are valid).
druid.server.http.unannouncePropagationDelay	PT0S (do not wait)	How long to wait for ZooKeeper unannouncements to propagate before shutting down Jetty. This is a minimum and druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout does not start counting down until after this period elapses.
druid.server.http.maxQueryTimeout	Long.MAX_VALUE	Maximum allowed value (in milliseconds) for timeout parameter. See [query-context](../querying/query-context.md) to know more about timeout. Query is rejected if the query context timeout is greater than this value. 
druid.server.http.maxRequestHeaderSize	8 * 1024	Maximum size of a request header in bytes. Larger headers consume more memory and can make a server more vulnerable to denial of service attacks.
druid.server.http.enableForwardedRequestCustomizer	false	If enabled, adds Jetty ForwardedRequestCustomizer which reads X-Forwarded-* request headers to manipulate servlet request object when Druid is used behind a proxy.
druid.server.http.allowedHttpMethods	[]	List of HTTP methods that should be allowed in addition to the ones required by Druid APIs. Druid APIs require GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE, which are always allowed. This option is not useful unless you have installed an extension that needs these additional HTTP methods or that adds functionality related to CORS. None of Druid's bundled extensions require these methods.
druid.server.http.contentSecurityPolicy	frame-ancestors 'none'	Content-Security-Policy header value to set on each non-POST response. Setting this property to an empty string, or omitting it, both result in the default frame-ancestors: none being set.
druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes	auto (max 1GiB)	This specifies a buffer size (less than 2GiB) for the storage of intermediate results. The computation engine in the Indexer processes will use a scratch buffer of this size to do all of their intermediate computations off-heap. Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed. [Human-readable format](human-readable-byte.md) is supported.
druid.processing.buffer.poolCacheMaxCount	Integer.MAX_VALUE	processing buffer pool caches the buffers for later use, this is the maximum count cache will grow to. note that pool can create more buffers than it can cache if necessary.
druid.processing.formatString	processing-%s	Indexer processes use this format string to name their processing threads.
druid.processing.numMergeBuffers	max(2, druid.processing.numThreads / 4)	The number of direct memory buffers available for merging query results. The buffers are sized by druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes. This property is effectively a concurrency limit for queries that require merging buffers. If you are using any queries that require merge buffers (currently, just groupBy v2) then you should have at least two of these.
druid.processing.numThreads	Number of cores - 1 (or 1)	The number of processing threads to have available for parallel processing of segments. Our rule of thumb is num_cores - 1, which means that even under heavy load there will still be one core available to do background tasks like talking with ZooKeeper and pulling down segments. If only one core is available, this property defaults to the value 1.
druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes	0 (disabled)	Maximum size in bytes for the dimension value lookup cache. Any value greater than 0 enables the cache. It is currently disabled by default. Enabling the lookup cache can significantly improve the performance of aggregators operating on dimension values, such as the JavaScript aggregator, or cardinality aggregator, but can slow things down if the cache hit rate is low (i.e. dimensions with few repeating values). Enabling it may also require additional garbage collection tuning to avoid long GC pauses.
druid.processing.fifo	true	If the processing queue should treat tasks of equal priority in a FIFO manner
druid.processing.tmpDir	path represented by java.io.tmpdir	Path where temporary files created while processing a query should be stored. If specified, this configuration takes priority over the default java.io.tmpdir path.
druid.realtime.cache.useCache	Enable the cache on the realtime.	true, false
druid.realtime.cache.populateCache	Populate the cache on the realtime.	true, false
druid.realtime.cache.unCacheable	All query types to not cache.	All druid query types
druid.realtime.cache.maxEntrySize	Maximum cache entry size in bytes.	positive integer
druid.host	InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName()	The host for the current process. This is used to advertise the current processes location as reachable from another process and should generally be specified such that http://${druid.host}/ could actually talk to this process
druid.bindOnHost	false	Indicating whether the process's internal jetty server bind on druid.host. Default is false, which means binding to all interfaces.
druid.plaintextPort	8083	This is the port to actually listen on; unless port mapping is used, this will be the same port as is on druid.host
druid.tlsPort	8283	TLS port for HTTPS connector, if [druid.enableTlsPort](../operations/tls-support.md) is set then this config will be used. If druid.host contains port then that port will be ignored. This should be a non-negative Integer.
druid.service	druid/historical	The name of the service. This is used as a dimension when emitting metrics and alerts to differentiate between the various services
druid.server.maxSize	Sum of maxSize values defined within druid.segmentCache.locations	The maximum number of bytes-worth of segments that the process wants assigned to it. The Coordinator process will attempt to assign segments to a Historical process only if this property is greater than the total size of segments served by it. Since this property defines the upper limit on the total segment size that can be assigned to a Historical, it is defaulted to the sum of all maxSize values specified within druid.segmentCache.locations property. Human-readable format is supported, see [here](human-readable-byte.md). 
druid.server.tier	  _default_tier 	 A string to name the distribution tier that the storage process belongs to. Many of the [rules Coordinator processes use](../operations/rule-configuration.md) to manage segments can be keyed on tiers. 
druid.server.priority	 0 	In a tiered architecture, the priority of the tier, thus allowing control over which processes are queried. Higher numbers mean higher priority. The default (no priority) works for architecture with no cross replication (tiers that have no data-storage overlap). Data centers typically have equal priority. 
druid.segmentCache.locations	 none 	Segments assigned to a Historical process are first stored on the local file system (in a disk cache) and then served by the Historical process. These locations define where that local cache resides. This value cannot be NULL or EMPTY. Here is an example druid.segmentCache.locations=[{"path": "/mnt/druidSegments", "maxSize": "10k", "freeSpacePercent": 1.0}]. "freeSpacePercent" is optional, if provided then enforces that much of free disk partition space while storing segments. But, it depends on File.getTotalSpace() and File.getFreeSpace() methods, so enable if only if they work for your File System.
druid.segmentCache.locationSelector.strategy	leastBytesUsed	The strategy used to select a location from the configured druid.segmentCache.locations for segment distribution. Possible values are leastBytesUsed, roundRobin, random, or mostAvailableSize. 
druid.segmentCache.deleteOnRemove	true	Delete segment files from cache once a process is no longer serving a segment.
druid.segmentCache.dropSegmentDelayMillis	30000 (30 seconds)	How long a process delays before completely dropping segment.
druid.segmentCache.infoDir	${first_location}/info_dir	Historical processes keep track of the segments they are serving so that when the process is restarted they can reload the same segments without waiting for the Coordinator to reassign. This path defines where this metadata is kept. Directory will be created if needed.
druid.segmentCache.announceIntervalMillis	5000 (5 seconds)	How frequently to announce segments while segments are loading from cache. Set this value to zero to wait for all segments to be loaded before announcing.
druid.segmentCache.numLoadingThreads	max(1,Number of cores / 6)	How many segments to drop or load concurrently from deep storage. Note that the work of loading segments involves downloading segments from deep storage, decompressing them and loading them to a memory mapped location. So the work is not all I/O Bound. Depending on CPU and network load, one could possibly increase this config to a higher value.
druid.segmentCache.numBootstrapThreads	druid.segmentCache.numLoadingThreads	How many segments to load concurrently during historical startup.
druid.segmentCache.lazyLoadOnStart	false	Whether or not to load segment columns metadata lazily during historical startup. When set to true, Historical startup time will be dramatically improved by deferring segment loading until the first time that segment takes part in a query, which will incur this cost instead.
druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.curator.numCallbackThreads	2	Number of threads for executing callback actions associated with loading or dropping of segments. One might want to increase this number when noticing clusters are lagging behind w.r.t. balancing segments across historical nodes.
druid.segmentCache.numThreadsToLoadSegmentsIntoPageCacheOnDownload	0	Number of threads to asynchronously read segment index files into null output stream on each new segment download after the historical process finishes bootstrapping. Recommended to set to 1 or 2 or leave unspecified to disable. See also druid.segmentCache.numThreadsToLoadSegmentsIntoPageCacheOnBootstrap
druid.segmentCache.numThreadsToLoadSegmentsIntoPageCacheOnBootstrap	druid.segmentCache.numThreadsToLoadSegmentsIntoPageCacheOnDownload	Number of threads to asynchronously read segment index files into null output stream during historical process bootstrap. This thread pool is terminated after historical process finishes bootstrapping. Recommended to set to half of available cores. If left unspecified, druid.segmentCache.numThreadsToLoadSegmentsIntoPageCacheOnDownload will be used. If both configs are unspecified, this feature is disabled. Preemptively loading segments into page cache helps in the sense that later when a segment is queried, it's already in page cache and only a minor page fault needs to be triggered instead of a more costly major page fault to make the query latency more consistent. Note that loading segment into page cache just does a blind loading of segment index files and will evict any existing segments from page cache at the discretion of operating system when the total segment size on local disk is larger than the page cache usable in the RAM, which roughly equals to total available RAM in the host - druid process memory including both heap and direct memory allocated - memory used by other non druid processes on the host, so it is the user's responsibility to ensure the host has enough RAM to host all the segments to avoid random evictions to fully leverage this feature.
druid.server.http.numThreads	max(10, (Number of cores * 17) / 16 + 2) + 30	Number of threads for HTTP requests.
druid.server.http.queueSize	Unbounded	Size of the worker queue used by Jetty server to temporarily store incoming client connections. If this value is set and a request is rejected by jetty because queue is full then client would observe request failure with TCP connection being closed immediately with a completely empty response from server.
druid.server.http.maxIdleTime	PT5M	The Jetty max idle time for a connection.
druid.server.http.enableRequestLimit	false	If enabled, no requests would be queued in jetty queue and "HTTP 429 Too Many Requests" error response would be sent. 
druid.server.http.defaultQueryTimeout	300000	Query timeout in millis, beyond which unfinished queries will be cancelled
druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout	PT30S	The maximum amount of time Jetty waits after receiving shutdown signal. After this timeout the threads will be forcefully shutdown. This allows any queries that are executing to complete(Only values greater than zero are valid).
druid.server.http.unannouncePropagationDelay	PT0S (do not wait)	How long to wait for ZooKeeper unannouncements to propagate before shutting down Jetty. This is a minimum and druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout does not start counting down until after this period elapses.
druid.server.http.maxQueryTimeout	Long.MAX_VALUE	Maximum allowed value (in milliseconds) for timeout parameter. See [query-context](../querying/query-context.md) to know more about timeout. Query is rejected if the query context timeout is greater than this value. 
druid.server.http.maxRequestHeaderSize	8 * 1024	Maximum size of a request header in bytes. Larger headers consume more memory and can make a server more vulnerable to denial of service attacks.
druid.server.http.contentSecurityPolicy	frame-ancestors 'none'	Content-Security-Policy header value to set on each non-POST response. Setting this property to an empty string, or omitting it, both result in the default frame-ancestors: none being set.
druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes	auto (max 1GiB)	This specifies a buffer size (less than 2GiB), for the storage of intermediate results. The computation engine in both the Historical and Realtime processes will use a scratch buffer of this size to do all of their intermediate computations off-heap. Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed.  [Human-readable format](human-readable-byte.md) is supported.
druid.processing.buffer.poolCacheMaxCount	Integer.MAX_VALUE	processing buffer pool caches the buffers for later use, this is the maximum count cache will grow to. note that pool can create more buffers than it can cache if necessary.
druid.processing.formatString	processing-%s	Realtime and Historical processes use this format string to name their processing threads.
druid.processing.numMergeBuffers	max(2, druid.processing.numThreads / 4)	The number of direct memory buffers available for merging query results. The buffers are sized by druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes. This property is effectively a concurrency limit for queries that require merging buffers. If you are using any queries that require merge buffers (currently, just groupBy v2) then you should have at least two of these.
druid.processing.numThreads	Number of cores - 1 (or 1)	The number of processing threads to have available for parallel processing of segments. Our rule of thumb is num_cores - 1, which means that even under heavy load there will still be one core available to do background tasks like talking with ZooKeeper and pulling down segments. If only one core is available, this property defaults to the value 1.
druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes	0 (disabled)	Maximum size in bytes for the dimension value lookup cache. Any value greater than 0 enables the cache. It is currently disabled by default. Enabling the lookup cache can significantly improve the performance of aggregators operating on dimension values, such as the JavaScript aggregator, or cardinality aggregator, but can slow things down if the cache hit rate is low (i.e. dimensions with few repeating values). Enabling it may also require additional garbage collection tuning to avoid long GC pauses.
druid.processing.fifo	true	If the processing queue should treat tasks of equal priority in a FIFO manner
druid.processing.tmpDir	path represented by java.io.tmpdir	Path where temporary files created while processing a query should be stored. If specified, this configuration takes priority over the default java.io.tmpdir path.
druid.historical.cache.useCache	Enable the cache on the Historical.	true, false
druid.historical.cache.populateCache	Populate the cache on the Historical.	true, false
druid.historical.cache.unCacheable	All query types to not cache.	All druid query types
druid.historical.cache.maxEntrySize	Maximum cache entry size in bytes.	positive integer
druid.host	InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName()	The host for the current process. This is used to advertise the current processes location as reachable from another process and should generally be specified such that http://${druid.host}/ could actually talk to this process
druid.bindOnHost	false	Indicating whether the process's internal jetty server bind on druid.host. Default is false, which means binding to all interfaces.
druid.plaintextPort	8082	This is the port to actually listen on; unless port mapping is used, this will be the same port as is on druid.host
druid.tlsPort	8282	TLS port for HTTPS connector, if [druid.enableTlsPort](../operations/tls-support.md) is set then this config will be used. If druid.host contains port then that port will be ignored. This should be a non-negative Integer.
druid.service	druid/broker	The name of the service. This is used as a dimension when emitting metrics and alerts to differentiate between the various services
druid.broker.balancer.type	Determines how the broker balances connections to Historical processes. random choose randomly, connectionCount picks the process with the fewest number of active connections to	random, connectionCount
druid.broker.select.tier	If segments are cross-replicated across tiers in a cluster, you can tell the broker to prefer to select segments in a tier with a certain priority.	highestPriority, lowestPriority, custom
druid.broker.select.tier.custom.priorities	Select servers in tiers with a custom priority list.	An array of integer priorities. E.g., [-1, 0, 1, 2]
druid.query.scheduler.numThreads	Unbounded	Maximum number of HTTP threads to dedicate to query processing. To save HTTP thread capacity, this should be lower than druid.server.http.numThreads, but it is worth noting that like druid.server.http.enableRequestLimit is set that query requests over this limit will be denied instead of waiting in the Jetty HTTP request queue.
druid.query.scheduler.laning.strategy	none	Query laning strategy to use to assign queries to a lane in order to control capacities for certain classes of queries.
druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.strategy	manual	Query prioritization strategy to automatically assign priorities.
druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.periodThreshold	None	ISO duration threshold for how old data can be queried before automatically adjusting query priority.
druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.durationThreshold	None	ISO duration threshold for maximum duration a queries interval can span before the priority is automatically adjusted.
druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.segmentCountThreshold	None	Number threshold for maximum number of segments that can take part in a query before its priority is automatically adjusted.
druid.query.scheduler.prioritization.adjustment	None	Amount to reduce the priority of queries which cross any threshold.
druid.query.scheduler.laning.maxLowPercent	No default, must be set if using this mode	Maximum percent of the smaller number of druid.server.http.numThreads or druid.query.scheduler.numThreads, defining the number of HTTP threads that can be used by queries with a priority lower than 0. Value must be an integer in the range 1 to 100, and will be rounded up
druid.query.scheduler.laning.lanes.{name}	No default, must define at least one lane with a limit above 0. If druid.query.scheduler.laning.isLimitPercent is set to true, values must be integers in the range of 1 to 100.	Maximum percent or exact limit of queries that can concurrently run in the defined lanes. Any number of lanes may be defined like this. The lane names 'total' and 'default' are reserved for internal use.
druid.query.scheduler.laning.isLimitPercent	false	If set to true, the values set for druid.query.scheduler.laning.lanes will be treated as a percent of the smaller number of druid.server.http.numThreads or druid.query.scheduler.numThreads. Note that in this mode, these lane values across lanes are _not_ required to add up to, and can exceed, 100%.
druid.server.http.numThreads	max(10, (Number of cores * 17) / 16 + 2) + 30	Number of threads for HTTP requests.
druid.server.http.queueSize	Unbounded	Size of the worker queue used by Jetty server to temporarily store incoming client connections. If this value is set and a request is rejected by jetty because queue is full then client would observe request failure with TCP connection being closed immediately with a completely empty response from server.
druid.server.http.maxIdleTime	PT5M	The Jetty max idle time for a connection.
druid.server.http.enableRequestLimit	false	If enabled, no requests would be queued in jetty queue and "HTTP 429 Too Many Requests" error response would be sent. 
druid.server.http.defaultQueryTimeout	300000	Query timeout in millis, beyond which unfinished queries will be cancelled
druid.server.http.maxScatterGatherBytes	Long.MAX_VALUE	Maximum number of bytes gathered from data processes such as Historicals and realtime processes to execute a query. Queries that exceed this limit will fail. This is an advance configuration that allows to protect in case Broker is under heavy load and not utilizing the data gathered in memory fast enough and leading to OOMs. This limit can be further reduced at query time using maxScatterGatherBytes in the context. Note that having large limit is not necessarily bad if broker is never under heavy concurrent load in which case data gathered is processed quickly and freeing up the memory used. Human-readable format is supported, see [here](human-readable-byte.md). 
druid.server.http.maxSubqueryRows	100000	Maximum number of rows from all subqueries per query. Druid stores the subquery rows in temporary tables that live in the Java heap. druid.server.http.maxSubqueryRows is a guardrail to prevent the system from exhausting available heap. When a subquery exceeds the row limit, Druid throws a resource limit exceeded exception: "Subquery generated results beyond maximum."<br /><br />It is a good practice to avoid large subqueries in Druid. However, if you choose to raise the subquery row limit, you must also increase the heap size of all Brokers, Historicals, and task Peons that process data for the subqueries to accommodate the subquery results.<br /><br />There is no formula to calculate the correct value. Trial and error is the best approach.
druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout	PT30S	The maximum amount of time Jetty waits after receiving shutdown signal. After this timeout the threads will be forcefully shutdown. This allows any queries that are executing to complete(Only values greater than zero are valid).
druid.server.http.unannouncePropagationDelay	PT0S (do not wait)	How long to wait for ZooKeeper unannouncements to propagate before shutting down Jetty. This is a minimum and druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout does not start counting down until after this period elapses.
druid.server.http.maxQueryTimeout	Long.MAX_VALUE	Maximum allowed value (in milliseconds) for timeout parameter. See [query-context](../querying/query-context.md) to know more about timeout. Query is rejected if the query context timeout is greater than this value. 
druid.server.http.maxRequestHeaderSize	8 * 1024	Maximum size of a request header in bytes. Larger headers consume more memory and can make a server more vulnerable to denial of service attacks. 
druid.server.http.contentSecurityPolicy	frame-ancestors 'none'	Content-Security-Policy header value to set on each non-POST response. Setting this property to an empty string, or omitting it, both result in the default frame-ancestors: none being set.
druid.broker.http.numConnections	20	Size of connection pool for the Broker to connect to Historical and real-time processes. If there are more queries than this number that all need to speak to the same process, then they will queue up.
druid.broker.http.eagerInitialization	true	Indicates that http connections from Broker to Historical and Real-time processes should be eagerly initialized. If set to true, numConnections connections are created upon initialization
druid.broker.http.compressionCodec	gzip	Compression codec the Broker uses to communicate with Historical and real-time processes. May be "gzip" or "identity".
druid.broker.http.readTimeout	PT15M	The timeout for data reads from Historical servers and real-time tasks.
druid.broker.http.unusedConnectionTimeout	PT4M	The timeout for idle connections in connection pool. The connection in the pool will be closed after this timeout and a new one will be established. This timeout should be less than druid.broker.http.readTimeout. Set this timeout = ~90% of druid.broker.http.readTimeout
druid.broker.http.maxQueuedBytes	25MB or 2% of maximum Broker heap size, whichever is greater	Maximum number of bytes queued per query before exerting backpressure on channels to the data servers.<br /><br />Similar to druid.server.http.maxScatterGatherBytes, except unlike that configuration, this one will trigger backpressure rather than query failure. Zero means disabled. Can be overridden by the ["maxQueuedBytes" query context parameter](../querying/query-context.md). Human-readable format is supported, see [here](human-readable-byte.md). 
druid.broker.http.numMaxThreads	max(10, ((number of cores * 17) / 16 + 2) + 30)	Maximum number of I/O worker threads
druid.broker.retryPolicy.numTries	1	Number of tries.
druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes	auto (max 1GiB)	This specifies a buffer size (less than 2GiB) for the storage of intermediate results. The computation engine in both the Historical and Realtime processes will use a scratch buffer of this size to do all of their intermediate computations off-heap. Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed. [Human-readable format](human-readable-byte.md) is supported.
druid.processing.buffer.poolCacheInitialCount	0	initializes the number of buffers allocated on the intermediate results pool. Note that pool can create more buffers if necessary.
druid.processing.buffer.poolCacheMaxCount	Integer.MAX_VALUE	processing buffer pool caches the buffers for later use, this is the maximum count cache will grow to. note that pool can create more buffers than it can cache if necessary.
druid.processing.numMergeBuffers	max(2, druid.processing.numThreads / 4)	The number of direct memory buffers available for merging query results. The buffers are sized by druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes. This property is effectively a concurrency limit for queries that require merging buffers. If you are using any queries that require merge buffers (currently, just groupBy v2) then you should have at least two of these.
druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes	0 (disabled)	Maximum size in bytes for the dimension value lookup cache. Any value greater than 0 enables the cache. It is currently disabled by default. Enabling the lookup cache can significantly improve the performance of aggregators operating on dimension values, such as the JavaScript aggregator, or cardinality aggregator, but can slow things down if the cache hit rate is low (i.e. dimensions with few repeating values). Enabling it may also require additional garbage collection tuning to avoid long GC pauses.
druid.processing.fifo	true	If the processing queue should treat tasks of equal priority in a FIFO manner
druid.processing.tmpDir	path represented by java.io.tmpdir	Path where temporary files created while processing a query should be stored. If specified, this configuration takes priority over the default java.io.tmpdir path.
druid.processing.merge.useParallelMergePool	true	Enable automatic parallel merging for Brokers on a dedicated async ForkJoinPool. If false, instead merges will be done serially on the HTTP thread pool.
druid.processing.merge.pool.parallelism	Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 0.75 (rounded up)	Size of ForkJoinPool. Note that the default configuration assumes that the value returned by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() represents 2 hyper-threads per physical core, and multiplies this value by 0.75 in attempt to size 1.5 times the number of _physical_ cores.
druid.processing.merge.pool.defaultMaxQueryParallelism	Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 0.5 (rounded up)	Default maximum number of parallel merge tasks per query. Note that the default configuration assumes that the value returned by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() represents 2 hyper-threads per physical core, and multiplies this value by 0.5 in attempt to size to the number of _physical_ cores.
druid.processing.merge.pool.awaitShutdownMillis	60_000	Time to wait for merge ForkJoinPool tasks to complete before ungracefully stopping on process shutdown in milliseconds.
druid.processing.merge.task.targetRunTimeMillis	100	Ideal run-time of each ForkJoinPool merge task, before forking off a new task to continue merging sequences.
druid.processing.merge.task.initialYieldNumRows	16384	Number of rows to yield per ForkJoinPool merge task, before forking off a new task to continue merging sequences.
druid.processing.merge.task.smallBatchNumRows	4096	Size of result batches to operate on in ForkJoinPool merge tasks.
druid.broker.internal.query.config.context	null	A string formatted key:value map of a query context to add to internally generated broker queries.
druid.sql.enable	true	Whether to enable SQL at all, including background metadata fetching. If false, this overrides all other SQL-related properties and disables SQL metadata, serving, and planning completely.
druid.sql.avatica.enable	true	Whether to enable JDBC querying at /druid/v2/sql/avatica/.
druid.sql.avatica.maxConnections	25	Maximum number of open connections for the Avatica server. These are not HTTP connections, but are logical client connections that may span multiple HTTP connections.
druid.sql.avatica.maxRowsPerFrame	5,000	Maximum acceptable value for the JDBC client Statement.setFetchSize method. This setting determines the maximum number of rows that Druid will populate in a single 'fetch' for a JDBC ResultSet. Set this property to -1 to enforce no row limit on the server-side and potentially return the entire set of rows on the initial statement execution. If the JDBC client calls Statement.setFetchSize with a value other than -1, Druid uses the lesser value of the client-provided limit and maxRowsPerFrame. If maxRowsPerFrame is smaller than minRowsPerFrame, then the ResultSet size will be fixed. To handle queries that produce results with a large number of rows, you can increase value of druid.sql.avatica.maxRowsPerFrame to reduce the number of fetches required to completely transfer the result set.
druid.sql.avatica.minRowsPerFrame	100	Minimum acceptable value for the JDBC client Statement.setFetchSize method. The value for this property must greater than 0. If the JDBC client calls Statement.setFetchSize with a lesser value, Druid uses minRowsPerFrame instead. If maxRowsPerFrame is less than minRowsPerFrame, Druid uses the minimum value of the two. For handling queries which produce results with a large number of rows, you can increase this value to reduce the number of fetches required to completely transfer the result set.
druid.sql.avatica.maxStatementsPerConnection	4	Maximum number of simultaneous open statements per Avatica client connection.
druid.sql.avatica.connectionIdleTimeout	PT5M	Avatica client connection idle timeout.
druid.sql.http.enable	true	Whether to enable JSON over HTTP querying at /druid/v2/sql/.
druid.sql.planner.maxTopNLimit	100000	Maximum threshold for a [TopN query](../querying/topnquery.md). Higher limits will be planned as [GroupBy queries](../querying/groupbyquery.md) instead.
druid.sql.planner.metadataRefreshPeriod	PT1M	Throttle for metadata refreshes.
druid.sql.planner.useApproximateCountDistinct	true	Whether to use an approximate cardinality algorithm for COUNT(DISTINCT foo).
druid.sql.planner.useGroupingSetForExactDistinct	false	Only relevant when useApproximateCountDistinct is disabled. If set to true, exact distinct queries are re-written using grouping sets. Otherwise, exact distinct queries are re-written using joins. This should be set to true for group by query with multiple exact distinct aggregations. This flag can be overridden per query.
druid.sql.planner.useApproximateTopN	true	Whether to use approximate [TopN queries](../querying/topnquery.md) when a SQL query could be expressed as such. If false, exact [GroupBy queries](../querying/groupbyquery.md) will be used instead.
druid.sql.planner.requireTimeCondition	false	Whether to require SQL to have filter conditions on __time column so that all generated native queries will have user specified intervals. If true, all queries without filter condition on __time column will fail
druid.sql.planner.sqlTimeZone	UTC	Sets the default time zone for the server, which will affect how time functions and timestamp literals behave. Should be a time zone name like "America/Los_Angeles" or offset like "-08:00".
druid.sql.planner.metadataSegmentCacheEnable	false	Whether to keep a cache of published segments in broker. If true, broker polls coordinator in background to get segments from metadata store and maintains a local cache. If false, coordinator's REST API will be invoked when broker needs published segments info.
druid.sql.planner.metadataSegmentPollPeriod	60000	How often to poll coordinator for published segments list if druid.sql.planner.metadataSegmentCacheEnable is set to true. Poll period is in milliseconds. 
druid.sql.planner.authorizeSystemTablesDirectly	false	If true, Druid authorizes queries against any of the system schema tables (sys in SQL) as SYSTEM_TABLE resources which require READ access, in addition to permissions based content filtering.
druid.sql.planner.useNativeQueryExplain	true	If true, EXPLAIN PLAN FOR will return the explain plan as a JSON representation of equivalent native query(s), else it will return the original version of explain plan generated by Calcite. It can be overridden per query with useNativeQueryExplain context key.
druid.sql.planner.maxNumericInFilters	-1 (disabled)	Max limit for the amount of numeric values that can be compared for a string type dimension when the entire SQL WHERE clause of a query translates to an [OR](../querying/filters.md#or) of [Bound filter](../querying/filters.md#bound-filter). By default, Druid does not restrict the amount of numeric Bound Filters on String columns, although this situation may block other queries from running. Set this property to a smaller value to prevent Druid from running queries that have prohibitively long segment processing times. The optimal limit requires some trial and error; we recommend starting with 100.  Users who submit a query that exceeds the limit of maxNumericInFilters should instead rewrite their queries to use strings in the WHERE clause instead of numbers. For example, WHERE someString IN (‘123’, ‘456’). If this value is disabled, maxNumericInFilters set through query context is ignored.
druid.sql.approxCountDistinct.function	APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_BUILTIN	Implementation to use for the [APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT function](../querying/sql-aggregations.md). Without extensions loaded, the only valid value is APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_BUILTIN (a HyperLogLog, or HLL, based implementation). If the [DataSketches extension](../development/extensions-core/datasketches-extension.md) is loaded, this can also be APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_HLL (alternative HLL implementation) or APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_THETA.<br /><br />Theta sketches use significantly more memory than HLL sketches, so you should prefer one of the two HLL implementations.
druid.broker.cache.useCache	Enable the cache on the Broker.	true, false
druid.broker.cache.populateCache	Populate the cache on the Broker.	true, false
druid.broker.cache.useResultLevelCache	Enable result level caching on the Broker.	true, false
druid.broker.cache.populateResultLevelCache	Populate the result level cache on the Broker.	true, false
druid.broker.cache.resultLevelCacheLimit	Maximum size of query response that can be cached.	positive integer
druid.broker.cache.unCacheable	All query types to not cache.	All druid query types

druid.broker.cache.maxEntrySize	Maximum cache entry size in bytes.	positive integer
druid.serverview.type	Segment discovery method to use. "http" enables discovering segments using HTTP instead of ZooKeeper.	batch or http
druid.broker.segment.watchedTiers	The Broker watches segment announcements from processes that serve segments to build a cache to relate each process to the segments it serves. This configuration allows the Broker to only consider segments being served from a list of tiers. By default, Broker considers all tiers. This can be used to partition your dataSources in specific Historical tiers and configure brokers in partitions so that they are only queryable for specific dataSources. This config is mutually exclusive from druid.broker.segment.ignoredTiers and at most one of these can be configured on a Broker.	List of strings
druid.broker.segment.ignoredTiers	The Broker watches segment announcements from processes that serve segments to build a cache to relate each process to the segments it serves. This configuration allows the Broker to ignore the segments being served from a list of tiers. By default, Broker considers all tiers. This config is mutually exclusive from druid.broker.segment.watchedTiers and at most one of these can be configured on a Broker.	List of strings
druid.broker.segment.watchedDataSources	Broker watches the segment announcements from processes serving segments to build cache of which process is serving which segments, this configuration allows to only consider segments being served from a whitelist of dataSources. By default, Broker would consider all datasources. This can be used to configure brokers in partitions so that they are only queryable for specific dataSources.	List of strings
druid.broker.segment.watchRealtimeTasks	The Broker watches segment announcements from processes that serve segments to build a cache to relate each process to the segments it serves.  When watchRealtimeTasks is true, the Broker watches for segment announcements from both Historicals and realtime processes. To configure a broker to exclude segments served by realtime processes, set watchRealtimeTasks to false. 	Boolean
druid.broker.segment.awaitInitializationOnStart	Whether the Broker will wait for its view of segments to fully initialize before starting up. If set to 'true', the Broker's HTTP server will not start up, and the Broker will not announce itself as available, until the server view is initialized.

druid.cache.useL2	true	A boolean indicating whether to query L2 cache, if it's a miss in L1. It makes sense to configure this to false on Historical processes, if L2 is a remote cache like memcached, and this cache also used on brokers, because in this case if a query reached Historical it means that a broker didn't find corresponding results in the same remote cache, so a query to the remote cache from Historical is guaranteed to be a miss.
druid.cache.populateL2	true	A boolean indicating whether to put results into L2 cache.
druid.query.topN.minTopNThreshold	1000	See [TopN Aliasing](../querying/topnquery.md#aliasing) for details.

druid.query.groupBy.forceHashAggregation	false	Force to use hash-based aggregation.
druid.query.groupBy.intermediateCombineDegree	8	Number of intermediate processes combined together in the combining tree. Higher degrees will need less threads which might be helpful to improve the query performance by reducing the overhead of too many threads if the server has sufficiently powerful CPU cores.
druid.query.groupBy.numParallelCombineThreads	1 (disabled)	Hint for the number of parallel combining threads. This should be larger than 1 to turn on the parallel combining feature. The actual number of threads used for parallel combining is min(druid.query.groupBy.numParallelCombineThreads, druid.processing.numThreads).
druid.query.groupBy.maxIntermediateRows	50000	Maximum number of intermediate rows for the per-segment grouping engine. This is a tuning parameter that does not impose a hard limit; rather, it potentially shifts merging work from the per-segment engine to the overall merging index. Queries that exceed this limit will not fail.
druid.query.groupBy.maxResults	500000	Maximum number of results. Queries that exceed this limit will fail.
druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans	false	Controls the behavior of Druid boolean operators and functions, if set to true all boolean values will be either a 1 or 0. See [expression documentation](../misc/math-expr.md#logical-operator-modes)

druid.router.defaultBrokerServiceName	druid/broker	The default Broker to connect to in case service discovery fails.
druid.router.tierToBrokerMap	{"_default_tier": "<defaultBrokerServiceName>"}	Queries for a certain tier of data are routed to their appropriate Broker. This value should be an ordered JSON map of tiers to Broker names. The priority of Brokers is based on the ordering.
