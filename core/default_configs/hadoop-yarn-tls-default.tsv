yarn.resourcemanager.fail-fast	${yarn.fail-fast}	Should RM fail fast if it encounters any errors. By defalt, it points to ${yarn.fail-fast}. Errors include: 1) exceptions when state-store write/read operations fails.
yarn.fail-fast	false	Should YARN fail fast if it encounters any errors. This is a global config for all other components including RM,NM etc. If no value is set for component-specific config (e.g yarn.resourcemanager.fail-fast), this value will be the default.
yarn.resourcemanager.work-preserving-recovery.enabled	true	Enable RM work preserving recovery. This configuration is private to YARN for experimenting the feature.
yarn.resourcemanager.work-preserving-recovery.scheduling-wait-ms	10000	Set the amount of time RM waits before allocating new containers on work-preserving-recovery. Such wait period gives RM a chance to settle down resyncing with NMs in the cluster on recovery, before assigning new containers to applications.
yarn.resourcemanager.store.class	org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.FileSystemRMStateStore	The class to use as the persistent store. If org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore is used, the store is implicitly fenced; meaning a single ResourceManager is able to use the store at any point in time. More details on this implicit fencing, along with setting up appropriate ACLs is discussed under yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.root-node.acl.
yarn.resourcemanager.state-store.max-completed-applications	${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}	The maximum number of completed applications RM state store keeps, less than or equals to ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}. By default, it equals to ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}. This ensures that the applications kept in the state store are consistent with the applications remembered in RM memory. Any values larger than ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications} will be reset to ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}. Note that this value impacts the RM recovery performance.Typically, a smaller value indicates better performance on RM recovery.
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-address		Host:Port of the ZooKeeper server to be used by the RM. This must be supplied when using the ZooKeeper based implementation of the RM state store and/or embedded automatic failover in a HA setting.
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-num-retries	1000	Number of times RM tries to connect to ZooKeeper.
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-retry-interval-ms	1000	Retry interval in milliseconds when connecting to ZooKeeper. When HA is enabled, the value here is NOT used. It is generated automatically from yarn.resourcemanager.zk-timeout-ms and yarn.resourcemanager.zk-num-retries.
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.parent-path	/rmstore	Full path of the ZooKeeper znode where RM state will be stored. This must be supplied when using org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore as the value for yarn.resourcemanager.store.class
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-timeout-ms	10000	ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires. Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat).
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl	world:anyone:rwcda	ACL's to be used for ZooKeeper znodes.
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.root-node.acl		ACLs to be used for the root znode when using ZKRMStateStore in a HA scenario for fencing. ZKRMStateStore supports implicit fencing to allow a single ResourceManager write-access to the store. For fencing, the ResourceManagers in the cluster share read-write-admin privileges on the root node, but the Active ResourceManager claims exclusive create-delete permissions. By default, when this property is not set, we use the ACLs from yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl for shared admin access and rm-address:random-number for username-based exclusive create-delete access. This property allows users to set ACLs of their choice instead of using the default mechanism. For fencing to work, the ACLs should be carefully set differently on each ResourceManger such that all the ResourceManagers have shared admin access and the Active ResourceManger takes over (exclusively) the create-delete access.
yarn.resourcemanager.zk-auth		Specify the auths to be used for the ACL's specified in both the yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl and yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.root-node.acl properties. This takes a comma-separated list of authentication mechanisms, each of the form 'scheme:auth' (the same syntax used for the 'addAuth' command in the ZK CLI).
yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.uri	${hadoop.tmp.dir}/yarn/system/rmstore	URI pointing to the location of the FileSystem path where RM state will be stored. This must be supplied when using org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.FileSystemRMStateStore as the value for yarn.resourcemanager.store.class

(2) The nodes in the RM ensemble are listed in yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm-ids (3) The id of each RM either comes from yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id if yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id is explicitly specified or can be figured out by matching yarn.resourcemanager.address.{id} with local address (4) The actual physical addresses come from the configs of the pattern - {rpc-config}.{id}
yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.enabled	true	Enable automatic failover. By default, it is enabled only when HA is enabled
yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.embedded	true	Enable embedded automatic failover. By default, it is enabled only when HA is enabled. The embedded elector relies on the RM state store to handle fencing, and is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with ZKRMStateStore.
yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.zk-base-path	/yarn-leader-election	The base znode path to use for storing leader information, when using ZooKeeper based leader election.

yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm-ids		The list of RM nodes in the cluster when HA is enabled. See description of yarn.resourcemanager.ha .enabled for full details on how this is used.
yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id		The id (string) of the current RM. When HA is enabled, this is an optional config. The id of current RM can be set by explicitly specifying yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id or figured out by matching yarn.resourcemanager.address.{id} with local address See description of yarn.resourcemanager.ha.enabled for full details on how this is used.
yarn.client.failover-proxy-provider	org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.ConfiguredRMFailoverProxyProvider	When HA is enabled, the class to be used by Clients, AMs and NMs to failover to the Active RM. It should extend org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.RMFailoverProxyProvider
yarn.client.failover-max-attempts		When HA is enabled, the max number of times FailoverProxyProvider should attempt failover. When set, this overrides the yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms. When not set, this is inferred from yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms.
yarn.client.failover-sleep-base-ms		When HA is enabled, the sleep base (in milliseconds) to be used for calculating the exponential delay between failovers. When set, this overrides the yarn.resourcemanager.connect.* settings. When not set, yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms is used instead.
yarn.client.failover-sleep-max-ms		When HA is enabled, the maximum sleep time (in milliseconds) between failovers. When set, this overrides the yarn.resourcemanager.connect.* settings. When not set, yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms is used instead.
yarn.client.failover-retries	0	When HA is enabled, the number of retries per attempt to connect to a ResourceManager. In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries to be used during failover attempts
yarn.client.failover-retries-on-socket-timeouts	0	When HA is enabled, the number of retries per attempt to connect to a ResourceManager on socket timeouts. In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts to be used during failover attempts
yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications	10000	The maximum number of completed applications RM keeps.
yarn.resourcemanager.delayed.delegation-token.removal-interval-ms	30000	Interval at which the delayed token removal thread runs
yarn.resourcemanager.proxy-user-privileges.enabled	false	If true, ResourceManager will have proxy-user privileges. Use case: In a secure cluster, YARN requires the user hdfs delegation-tokens to do localization and log-aggregation on behalf of the user. If this is set to true, ResourceManager is able to request new hdfs delegation tokens on behalf of the user. This is needed by long-running-service, because the hdfs tokens will eventually expire and YARN requires new valid tokens to do localization and log-aggregation. Note that to enable this use case, the corresponding HDFS NameNode has to configure ResourceManager as the proxy-user so that ResourceManager can itself ask for new tokens on behalf of the user when tokens are past their max-life-time.
yarn.resourcemanager.am-rm-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs	86400	Interval for the roll over for the master key used to generate application tokens
yarn.resourcemanager.container-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs	86400	Interval for the roll over for the master key used to generate container tokens. It is expected to be much greater than yarn.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms and yarn.resourcemanager.rm.container-allocation.expiry-interval-ms. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.policies	org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.monitor.capacity.ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy	The list of SchedulingEditPolicy classes that interact with the scheduler. A particular module may be incompatible with the scheduler, other policies, or a configuration of either.
yarn.resourcemanager.configuration.provider-class	org.apache.hadoop.yarn.LocalConfigurationProvider	The class to use as the configuration provider. If org.apache.hadoop.yarn.LocalConfigurationProvider is used, the local configuration will be loaded. If org.apache.hadoop.yarn.FileSystemBasedConfigurationProvider is used, the configuration which will be loaded should be uploaded to remote File system first.

yarn.nodemanager.container-executor.class	org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.DefaultContainerExecutor	who will execute(launch) the containers.
yarn.nodemanager.container-manager.thread-count	20	Number of threads container manager uses.
yarn.nodemanager.delete.thread-count	4	Number of threads used in cleanup.
yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec	0	Number of seconds after an application finishes before the nodemanager's DeletionService will delete the application's localized file directory and log directory. To diagnose Yarn application problems, set this property's value large enough (for example, to 600 = 10 minutes) to permit examination of these directories. After changing the property's value, you must restart the nodemanager in order for it to have an effect. The roots of Yarn applications' work directories is configurable with the yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs property (see below), and the roots of the Yarn applications' log directories is configurable with the yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs property (see also below).
yarn.nodemanager.keytab	/etc/krb5.keytab	Keytab for NM.
yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs	${hadoop.tmp.dir}/nm-local-dir	List of directories to store localized files in. An application's localized file directory will be found in: ${yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs}/usercache/${user}/appcache/application_${appid}. Individual containers' work directories, called container_${contid}, will be subdirectories of this.
yarn.nodemanager.local-cache.max-files-per-directory	8192	It limits the maximum number of files which will be localized in a single local directory. If the limit is reached then sub-directories will be created and new files will be localized in them. If it is set to a value less than or equal to 36 [which are sub-directories (0-9 and then a-z)] then NodeManager will fail to start. For example; [for public cache] if this is configured with a value of 40 ( 4 files + 36 sub-directories) and the local-dir is "/tmp/local-dir1" then it will allow 4 files to be created directly inside "/tmp/local-dir1/filecache". For files that are localized further it will create a sub-directory "0" inside "/tmp/local-dir1/filecache" and will localize files inside it until it becomes full. If a file is removed from a sub-directory that is marked full, then that sub-directory will be used back again to localize files.
yarn.nodemanager.localizer.address	${yarn.nodemanager.hostname}:8040	Address where the localizer IPC is.

Individual containers' log directories will be below this, in directories named container_{$contid}. Each container directory will contain the files stderr, stdin, and syslog generated by that container.
yarn.log-aggregation-enable	false	Whether to enable log aggregation. Log aggregation collects each container's logs and moves these logs onto a file-system, for e.g. HDFS, after the application completes. Users can configure the "yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir" and "yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix" properties to determine where these logs are moved to. Users can access the logs via the Application Timeline Server.
yarn.log-aggregation.retain-seconds	-1	How long to keep aggregation logs before deleting them. -1 disables. Be careful set this too small and you will spam the name node.
yarn.log-aggregation.retain-check-interval-seconds	-1	How long to wait between aggregated log retention checks. If set to 0 or a negative value then the value is computed as one-tenth of the aggregated log retention time. Be careful set this too small and you will spam the name node.

This correspond to both yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs. i.e. If there are less number of healthy local-dirs (or log-dirs) available, then new containers will not be launched on this node.
yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.max-disk-utilization-per-disk-percentage	90.0	The maximum percentage of disk space utilization allowed after which a disk is marked as bad. Values can range from 0.0 to 100.0. If the value is greater than or equal to 100, the nodemanager will check for full disk. This applies to yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs.
yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.min-free-space-per-disk-mb	0	The minimum space that must be available on a disk for it to be used. This applies to yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs and yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs.

yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.limit-users	true	This determines which of the two modes that LCE should use on a non-secure cluster. If this value is set to true, then all containers will be launched as the user specified in yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.local-user. If this value is set to false, then containers will run as the user who submitted the application.
yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.local-user	nobody	The UNIX user that containers will run as when Linux-container-executor is used in nonsecure mode (a use case for this is using cgroups) if the yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.limit-users is set to true.

yarn.nodemanager.process-kill-wait.ms	2000	Max time to wait for a process to come up when trying to cleanup a container
yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.minimum.version	NONE	The minimum allowed version of a resourcemanager that a nodemanager will connect to. The valid values are NONE (no version checking), EqualToNM (the resourcemanager's version is equal to or greater than the NM version), or a Version String.
yarn.client.nodemanager-client-async.thread-pool-max-size	500	Max number of threads in NMClientAsync to process container management events
yarn.client.nodemanager-connect.max-wait-ms	180000	Max time to wait to establish a connection to NM
yarn.client.nodemanager-connect.retry-interval-ms	10000	Time interval between each attempt to connect to NM
yarn.client.max-cached-nodemanagers-proxies	0	Maximum number of proxy connections to cache for node managers. If set to a value greater than zero then the cache is enabled and the NMClient and MRAppMaster will cache the specified number of node manager proxies. There will be at max one proxy per node manager. Ex. configuring it to a value of 5 will make sure that client will at max have 5 proxies cached with 5 different node managers. These connections for these proxies will be timed out if idle for more than the system wide idle timeout period. Note that this could cause issues on large clusters as many connections could linger simultaneously and lead to a large number of connection threads. The token used for authentication will be used only at connection creation time. If a new token is received then the earlier connection should be closed in order to use the new token. This and (yarn.client.nodemanager-client-async.thread-pool-max-size) are related and should be in sync (no need for them to be equal). If the value of this property is zero then the connection cache is disabled and connections will use a zero idle timeout to prevent too many connection threads on large clusters.
